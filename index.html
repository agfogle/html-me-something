            <p> If you're thinking about planning a girls trip - DO IT! I recently took a trip to <strong>Cancun, Mexico</strong>
                with some of my best friends and I have highlighted some of the activities that made it worthwile.

            <h3 class ="triphighlight"> My Best Girl Friends: Mina, Kia, Cassy</h3>
            <div class = "description">I went on my trip with 3 of my childhood friends. Collectively, we have been friends since high school but some ties began even earlier - in elementary. We had never taken a trip together before (at least not like this) so we thought now was a better time than never.</p>

            <h3 class ="triphighlight">Our Location: Cancun, Mexico</h3>
            <div class = "description">We decided on Cancun for the following reasons:
                    <ul>
                        <li>None of us had visited before</li>
                        <li>We wanted to go somewhere with all-inclusive options</li>
                        <li>It was guaranteed to be a good time!</li>
                    </ul>
                    We stayed at <a href = "https://www.dreamsresorts.com/en_us/resorts/mexico/sands-cancun.html" target = _blank>Dreams Sands-Cancun Resort</a>. It was a family-friendly resort and was a bit slower paced than other resorts we had heard about but it got the job done.
            </div>
           
            <h3 class ="triphighlight">Fun activities: Ziplining, Parasailing, Dancing and More...</h3>
            <div class = "description">We loaded up on activites on this trip. We began with parasailing. This was exhilarating and terrfiyng all at the same time and I will probably never do it again. We also went to an adventure park for some zipling. We completed 10 ziplines and also swam in cenote'. The cenote' left me speechless. It was such a beautiful and peaceful place! On the final day, we went jet skiing.
            I've done that before and it is always a good time. We even had a chance to explore the nightlife.
